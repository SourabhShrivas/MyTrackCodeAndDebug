Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. Let's break down the concept of recursion using a simple example, factorial calculation, with both parameterized recursion and a recursive function.

Factorial Calculation Example:

Factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Parameterized Recursion:Here's a parameterized recursive function to calculate the factorial:

def factorial_recursive(n, result=1):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return result
    else:
        return factorial_recursive(n - 1, result * n)
Now, let's understand how this function works step by step with an example of calculating factorial for n = 5:

Step 1: factorial_recursive(5, 1)
Step 2: Since n (5) is not 0 or 1, we go to the else block.
Step 3: The function calls itself with factorial_recursive(4, 5).
Step 4: Since n (4) is not 0 or 1, we go to the else block again.
Step 5: The function calls itself with factorial_recursive(3, 20).
Step 6: This process repeats until factorial_recursive(1, 60) is called.
Step 7: At this point, n is 1, so it returns 60 (60 * 1).
Step 8: The previous calls resolve in the reverse order, multiplying their respective n with the accumulated result.
Step 9: Finally, factorial_recursive(5, 1) returns 120, which is the factorial of 5.
Function with Recursion:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
Let's break down how this function works with the same example of calculating factorial for n = 5:

Step 1: factorial(5)
Step 2: Since n (5) is not 0 or 1, we go to the else block.
Step 3: The function calls itself with 5 * factorial(4).
Step 4: This process repeats until factorial(1) is called.
Step 5: At this point, n is 1, so it returns 1.
Step 6: The previous calls resolve in the reverse order, multiplying their respective n with the accumulated result.
Step 7: Finally, factorial(5) returns 120, which is the factorial of 5.
Both methods achieve the same result, but parameterized recursion allows passing additional parameters to the recursive calls, which can be useful in certain scenarios.
