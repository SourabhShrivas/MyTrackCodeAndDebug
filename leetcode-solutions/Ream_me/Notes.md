TC and SC to remember - 

- min() and max() functions: O(n) in the worst-case scenario, O(1) if the list is already sorted.
- sum() function: O(n) since it iterates through all elements in the list once.
- Sort O(n logn)
- set .add method will take O(1) to see and add item in set
- IN and NOT INT operator takes 
        - O(n^2) in list/tuple/string 
        - O(1) dict and sets
- IN and NOT INT operator takes O(n) in DICT and SET
- Remove TC - O(n)
- append TC - O(1)
